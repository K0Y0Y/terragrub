# Terragrub
A Terraria theme for GRUB and nothing else.
I'll be updating this theme as I can to fix some issues until it's finished.

## Disclaimer
First of all, thanks to Lxtharia for Minegrub theme (you can check it right here https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme). I used this theme as an inspiration. I really enjoyed this theme and I wanted to give some credit for it.

Secondly, Terragrub was made just for my needs.
Terraria is one of my favorite games of all time, so I looked for a GRUB theme or something closer, but I did not find anything, so I made my own theme.
## Warning
**This theme is incomplete and need some extra work. Use it under your resposability.**

## Installation
There's nothing here. I'll add the installation process later.
